This is tutorial 12 for Spring MVC which uses Spring form elements for checkboxes in a webpage.

The only change from tutorial 11 is in index.jsp, hello.jsp, Information.java and HelloController.java

1. In index.jsp the checkboxes are defined to select Visited Countries by using Spring form elements.
2. In Information.java an array of visitedCountries[] is defined.
3. In HelloController.java a LinkedhashMap<String, String> country is defined to store the checkbox values selected.
4. In hello.jsp the list of Visited Countries is shown using JSTL tag.

If you are writing the code from scratch then make sure to verify the steps given in tutorial 1 SpringMvcTemplate project.

Just remember to update Context root and package name to tutorial12.springmvc after copying tutorial 11 SpringFormElementsTextArea project.
